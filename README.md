Individual Project
Heart Disease Dataset
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland,
and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published
experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.
It is integer-valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
This is a multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of separate
mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis.
It is composed of 14 attributes.
One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict, based on the given attributes of a patient
that whether that particular person has heart disease or not, and the other is the experimental
task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset, which could help in
understanding the problem more.
There are various factors associated with the process of determining whether a person will have
heart disease or not. In this project, we will do an analysis of some hypotheses and will come up
with some conclusions for the same.
Dataset columns:
1) age: The person’s age in years
2) sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
3) cp: chest pain type
— Value 0: asymptomatic
— Value 1: atypical angina
— Value 2: non-anginal pain
— Value 3: typical angina
4) trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5) chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
6) fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
7) restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
Value 1: normal
Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression
of > 0.05 mV)
8) thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved
9) exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10) oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the
ECG plot. See more here)
11) slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
12) ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)
13) thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset
previously
Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
Value 2: normal blood flow
Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)
14) target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
Note: I have stated the hypothesis, conclusion, and all the supporting evidence that led
to the conclusion in the R file.
Here I am giving an overview of the analysis which I have performed
